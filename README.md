ðŸ’» Aspiring Full Stack Developer
ðŸ¤”I'm looking for help with getting some interviews and internships to gain real-world experience  and grow as a developer.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full stack food delivery website using the MERN stack. The project includes features like user registration and login and browsing food items, adding items to cart, placing orders, and processing payments with Stripe. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for data management.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MERN stack development for creating full-stack web applications.
